# Text-Classification-pytorch
- Text classification by CNN, RNN, ensembled methods
- architecture of rnn is similiar to this [paper](http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/download/9745/9552)
- code about CNN is borrowed from [here](https://github.com/galsang/CNN-sentence-classification-pytorch)
